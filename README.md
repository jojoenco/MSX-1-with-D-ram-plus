This One is not Tested jet.

The board is in production, so there is no information about the mistakes I made.
I think the big problem will be the current for the Floppy drive, and the voltage drop because of that.
I made the connections for the power of the floppy bigger but i'm not sure it will help enough.

I removed the Relay and the Dinn connection for the cassete (but there is still a 3,5" jack for cassete)
I also removed the Printer port.
All this to make room for the rest of the parts.

The PCB came in (a quick not that sharp Photo)
